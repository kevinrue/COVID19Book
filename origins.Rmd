# Origins of this package {-}

John C. Mallery conveyed code of Charles Morefield to harvest COVID-19
time series data.  Vince Carey then started an R package/github repo
to manage the relevant code.  The package was named `sars2pack` in
hopes of avoiding name conflict with many other packages while
remaining descriptive and focused.
